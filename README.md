# team-profile-generator

## Description
This team profile generator utilizes the node package manager along with the inquirer package, and general principles of Object Oriented Programming. The application runs in the terminal utilizing the command "node index.js". A user is prompted for information regarding the team they are building, and upon completing the program, a fully-styled index.html file is produced in the dist folder, and the user may examing their new team profile on a live server. Promises were an especially useful tool utilized throughout the program, and comments in the javascript files illustrate the developer's newfound appreciation of them.
